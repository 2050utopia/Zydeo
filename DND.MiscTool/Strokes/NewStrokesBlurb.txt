// this file contains stroke data for use by HanziDict's C# port

// format of the file is as follows:
// each line is the data for a single character
// first item is unicode in hex, followed by space
// second item is character type: S = simplified, T = traditional, B = both
// strokes follow, separated by "|" characters
// strokes can be divided into substrokes, substrokes defined by (direction, length)
// substrokes separated by "#" characters
// direction is in radians, 0 to the right, PI/2 up, etc... length is from 0-1
